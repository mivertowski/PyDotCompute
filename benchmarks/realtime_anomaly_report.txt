WHY THIS BENCHMARK MATTERS
======================================================================

This benchmark demonstrates the KEY ADVANTAGE of GPU Actors:
PERSISTENT GPU STATE eliminates repeated host-device transfers.

In streaming scenarios:
- Data arrives in micro-batches (like Kafka, sensor data, metrics)
- Context (window history) must be maintained
- Traditional batch processing transfers context EVERY batch
- GPU Actors keep context on GPU - transfer ONCE!

The longer the stream runs, the more GPU Actors win!

TRANSFER OVERHEAD ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Stateless Batch must transfer window state EACH batch:
  100,000 pts, batch 100: 27.1% time spent on transfers
  100,000 pts, batch 500: 19.7% time spent on transfers
  100,000 pts, batch 1,000: 16.9% time spent on transfers
  500,000 pts, batch 100: 27.8% time spent on transfers
  500,000 pts, batch 500: 21.1% time spent on transfers
  500,000 pts, batch 1,000: 17.0% time spent on transfers
  1,000,000 pts, batch 100: 27.8% time spent on transfers
  1,000,000 pts, batch 500: 20.6% time spent on transfers
  1,000,000 pts, batch 1,000: 16.1% time spent on transfers

======================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
======================================================================

1. GPU ACTORS ADVANTAGE: Persistent GPU state
   - Window buffer stays on GPU between batches
   - No repeated transfers = higher throughput

2. WHEN GPU ACTORS WIN:
   - Streaming workloads with many micro-batches
   - Large context/window sizes
   - Long-running processing pipelines

3. WHEN BATCH PROCESSING WINS:
   - Very large batch sizes (transfer amortized)
   - One-shot processing
   - Small context requirements

4. REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
   - IoT sensor monitoring
